# go-discord-archiver

Discord bot for archive.org, written in Go

## Configuration

Set some environment variables before launching, or add a `.env` file.

If database environment variables are provided, the bot will save stats to an external database.
Otherwise, it will save stats to a local sqlite database at `/var/go-discord-archiver/local.db`

## Usage

React to a message that has links with üèõ (The "classical building" emoji) and the bot will respond in the channel with an archive.org link for the link(s). It saves the page to archive.org if needed.

- You can also right-click (or long press) a message and use "Get snapshot" to get a message with snapshots that only you can see.

**This is a pretty good way to get around paywalls to read articles for free.**

### Commands

Configure the bot:

`/settings`

Get a snapshot for one URL in a message visible only to you:

`/archive`

Get stats for the bot:

`/stats`

Get this help message:

`/help`

### NOTES

- It can take up to a few minutes for archive.org to save a page, so if you don't get a link immediately, please be patient.

## Development

Create a `.env` file with your configuration, at the bare minimum you need
a Discord token for `TOKEN` and an Archive.org Cookie for `COOKIE` (Need at least `PHPSESSID`, `logged-in-sig` and `logged-in-user`, looks like: `PHPSESSID=12345; logged-in-sig=54321; logged-in-user=example%40example.com`).

Logins are currently good for a year.
You can either `docker compose up --build` to run with a mysql database, or just `go run main.go` to run with a sqlite database.
