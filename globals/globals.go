	React to a message that has links with üèõ (The "classical building" emoji) and the bot will respond in the channel with an archive.org link for the link(s). It saves the page to archive.org if needed. 
You can also right-click (or long press) a message and use "Get snapshots" to get a message with snapshots for any link that only you can see.

**This is a pretty good way to get around paywalls to read articles for free.**

Configure the bot with slash commands:
` + "`/settings`" + `

Get a snapshot for one URL in a message visible only to you:
` + "`/archive`" + `

Get stats for the bot:
` + "`/stats`" + `

Get this help message:
` + "`/help`"
	BotHelpFooterText = "It can take up to a few minutes for archive.org to save a page, so if you don't get a link immediately, please be patient."
