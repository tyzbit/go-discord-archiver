	React to a message that has links with üèõ (The "classical building" emoji) and the bot will respond in the channel with an archive.org link for the link(s). It saves the page to archive.org if needed.

**This is a pretty good way to get around paywalls to read articles for free.**

Configure the bot with slash commands:
` + "`/settings`" + `

Get stats for the bot:
` + "`/stats`" + `

Get this help message:
` + "`/help`"
